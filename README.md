# 📧 MailTraceX

### Email Header & URL Forensic Analyzer

MailTraceX is a Python-based email forensics and phishing detection tool designed to analyze raw email headers and embedded URLs. It helps identify spoofed and malicious emails by extracting routing information, validating authentication mechanisms (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), detecting suspicious links, and scanning URLs using the VirusTotal API.

This tool is ideal for **SOC analysts, DFIR professionals, cybersecurity students, and blue team operations**.

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Phishing email investigation
* SOC alert triage
* Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
* Cybersecurity education and demonstrations
* Blue team threat analysis

---

## 🧠 Risk Scoring Logic (Overview)

The risk score is calculated based on:

* SPF / DKIM / DMARC failures
* Number of mail relay hops
* Presence of suspicious URLs
* VirusTotal malicious detections
* Timestamp inconsistencies

**Score Interpretation:**

* `0–39` → Low Risk
* `40–69` → Medium Risk
* `70+` → High Risk (Likely Phishing)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Web-based dashboard (Flask / FastAPI)
* PDF forensic report generation
* WHOIS & domain age analysis
* Bulk email header analysis
* SIEM-compatible JSON output
* Machine learning–based phishing classification
